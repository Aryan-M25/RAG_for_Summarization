THE SPEED CONTROL CABLE END FITTING CAN ALLOW WATER TO ENTER THE SPEED CONTROL SERVO ASSEMBLY.  IF THIS OCCURS, CORROSION IN THE SERVO ASSEMBLY COULD DEVELOP AND CAUSE INTERMITTENT SPEED CONTROL OPERATION OR PREVENT THE THROTTLE FROM RETURNING TO IDLE. A THROTTLE THAT DOES NOT RETURN TO IDLE COULD RESULT IN UNEXPECTED ACCELERATION, INCREASING THE RISK OF A CRASH. DEALERS WILL REPLACE THE SPEED CONTROL CABLE (WITH A NEW CABLE THAT INCORPORATES A GLASS-FILLED END CAP) AND INSPECT THE ASSEMBLY FOR INTERNAL CORROSION.  SERVOS WITH EVIDENCE OF CORROSION WILL ALSO BE REPLACED.  OWNERS ARE ADVISED NOT TO USE THE SPEED CONTROL UNTIL THE VEHICLES ARE REPAIRED. VEHICLE DESCRIPTION:  PASSENGER VEHICLES EQUIPPED WITH SPEED CONTROL AND AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION.  A SPEED CONTROL CABLE COULD HAVE A CORE WIRE THAT IS LONG ENOUGH TO CATCH ON THE SLEEVE AT THE THROTTLE BODY END OF THE CABLE DURING WIDE-OPEN THROTTLE ACCELERATION. A THROTTLE THAT DOES NOT RETURN TO IDLE COULD RESULT IN REDUCED VEHICLE CONTROL AND, POTENTIALLY, A VEHICLE CRASH. DEALERS WILL INSPECT THESE VEHICLES AND, IF NECESSARY, REPLACE THE SPEED CONTROL CABLE.  OWNER NOTIFICATION BEGAN OCTOBER 12, 2000.   OWNERS WHO TAKE THEIR VEHICLES TO AN AUTHORIZED DEALER ON AN AGREED UPON SERVICE DATE AND DO NOT RECEIVE THE FREE REMEDY WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME SHOULD CONTACT FORD AT 1-800-392-3673. ON CERTAIN PASSENGER VEHICLES, CONTAMINATION OF THE FILTER IN THE FUEL DELIVERY MODULE (FDM) CAN REDUCE, AND EVENTUALLY BLOCK, THE FLOW OF FUEL TO THE ENGINE. THIS MAY CAUSE ENGINE HESITATION, LOSS OF POWER, SURGING, AND OTHER SIMILAR  SYMPTOMS.  OVER TIME, THE FILTER MAY BECOME SUFFICIENTLY BLOCKED TO CAUSE THE ENGINE TO STALL, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A CRASH. THIS ACTION IS DEEMED A SAFETY IMPROVEMENT CAMPAIGN AND IS NOT BEING CONDUCTED UNDER THE SAFETY ACT.  ALL OWNERS WILL BE NOTIFIED OF THE PROBLEM, AND DEALERS WILL REPLACE THE FDM WITH A NEW DESIGN AT NO CHARGE IF THE OWNER REPORTS THAT THE VEHICLE EXHIBITS ANY OF THE IDENTIFIED SYMPTOMS.  THE FREE REPLACEMENT WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR A PERIOD OF 10 YEARS FOLLOWING THE ORIGINAL PURCHASE OF THE VEHICLE, WITH NO MILEAGE LIMIT.  OWNER NOTIFICATION IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN DURING NOVEMBER 2003.

OWNERS WHO TAKE THEIR VEHICLES TO AN AUTHORIZED DEALER ON AN AGREED UPON SERVICE DATE AND DO NOT RECEIVE THE FREE REMEDY WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME SHOULD CONTACT FORD AT 1-800-392-3673. ON CERTAIN PASSENGER VEHICLES, CONTAMINATION OF THE FILTER IN THE FUEL DELIVERY MODULE (FDM) CAN REDUCE, AND EVENTUALLY BLOCK, THE FLOW OF FUEL TO THE ENGINE. THIS MAY CAUSE ENGINE HESITATION, LOSS OF POWER, SURGING, AND OTHER SIMILAR  SYMPTOMS.  OVER TIME, THE FILTER MAY BECOME SUFFICIENTLY BLOCKED TO CAUSE THE ENGINE TO STALL, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A CRASH. THIS ACTION IS DEEMED A SAFETY IMPROVEMENT CAMPAIGN AND IS NOT BEING CONDUCTED UNDER THE SAFETY ACT.  ALL OWNERS WILL BE NOTIFIED OF THE PROBLEM, AND DEALERS WILL REPLACE THE FDM WITH A NEW DESIGN AT NO CHARGE IF THE OWNER REPORTS THAT THE VEHICLE EXHIBITS ANY OF THE IDENTIFIED SYMPTOMS.

The primary issue is that certain components may become blocked or corroded due to exposure to environmental factors such as water and humidity. This can lead to reduced power delivery from the engine which could result in stalling conditions leading up to crashes if not addressed promptly. Additionally there were concerns about possible failure modes within these systems causing unexpected acceleration events during normal driving operations. These issues are considered serious safety risks by regulators around the world who have taken steps towards mandating recalls for affected vehicles until appropriate fixes are implemented through dealership service centers.\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":38},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
